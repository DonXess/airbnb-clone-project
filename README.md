## 🧱 Technology Stack

The Airbnb Clone project uses a powerful combination of tools and technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is used to build the core of the backend and handle HTTP requests, routing, and application logic.

### 🔗 Django REST Framework (DRF)
A flexible and powerful toolkit for building Web APIs on top of Django. It provides tools to serialize data, handle authentication, permissions, and CRUD operations for users, properties, bookings, etc.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source relational database system used to store and manage structured data like users, bookings, payments, and property details.

### 🔎 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It is used to offer a more efficient, flexible alternative to traditional REST endpoints.

### 🕒 Celery
An asynchronous task queue/job queue system used for handling background tasks such as sending booking confirmation emails or processing payments without blocking the main application flow.

### 🚀 Redis
An in-memory data store used as a caching layer to speed up data access and improve performance. Also used by Celery as a message broker for task management.

### 🐳 Docker
A containerization platform used to create reproducible, isolated environments for development and deployment, ensuring consistency across all stages of the project lifecycle.

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions or similar)
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are set up to automatically test, build, and deploy the application, minimizing manual errors and improving development speed.
